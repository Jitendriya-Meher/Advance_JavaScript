// Creation Phase:
// During the creation phase, JavaScript prepares for the execution of code by setting up the necessary components such as variables, functions, and scope. This phase is often associated with the concept of "hoisting," where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope.

// Key steps during the Creation Phase include:

// Variable and Function Declarations: JavaScript scans through the code and hoists variable declarations (var) and function declarations to the top of their containing scope. This means you can use a variable or call a function before its actual declaration in the code.

// Scope Creation: JavaScript creates the scope chain and establishes the variable environment and lexical environment for each execution context. This is important for determining how variables and functions are accessed within different scopes.

// this Binding: The this value is set based on the context in which a function is called. It's determined during the creation phase but may be used and accessed during the execution phase.

// Execution Phase:
// The execution phase is where the actual code execution takes place. It follows the creation phase and involves running through the code line by line, executing statements, and performing calculations.

// Key aspects of the Execution Phase include:

// Assignment and Execution: Code statements are executed in the order they appear in the code. Variables are assigned values, functions are invoked, and operations are performed.

// Access to Hoisted Variables and Functions: Because of hoisting, you can access and use variables and functions even before they are explicitly declared in the code.

// Closure Creation: Closures are formed during the execution phase when inner functions retain access to their outer function's variables, even after the outer function has finished executing.

// Event Handling: In a browser environment, event listeners and asynchronous operations are set up during the execution phase. Callback functions associated with events are queued for execution in response to user interactions.

// Updating the Call Stack: Function calls are added to the call stack during execution and removed when the functions complete their execution. This maintains the order of function calls and ensures proper control flow.

// Hoisting:
// Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the creation phase. This allows you to use variables and call functions before they are formally declared in the code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the assignments.
