        // Parser:
        // The parser is the first step in the JavaScript execution process. It takes the raw JavaScript code as input and converts it into a data structure known as the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST represents the hierarchical structure of the code and is easier for the engine to understand and process.

        // During parsing, the code is broken down into meaningful tokens (such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals), and the parser creates a tree structure that represents the code's syntax and semantics. This tree is used by the JavaScript engine for further processing and execution.


        
        // JavaScript Engine:
        // The JavaScript engine is responsible for interpreting and executing the parsed JavaScript code. Each web browser has its own JavaScript engine, and there are also standalone engines like Node.js for server-side JavaScript.

        // Key components and steps within a JavaScript engine's execution process include:

        // Memory Heap: This is where memory allocation occurs for storing variables, objects, and function closures during runtime.

        // Call Stack: The call stack keeps track of function calls in the program. When a function is invoked, a new frame is added to the call stack, and when the function completes, its frame is removed.

        // Execution Context: This represents the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It includes information about variables, functions, and the scope chain.

        // Variable Environment: The part of an execution context that holds the variable declarations, functions, and function arguments.

        // Lexical Environment: The structure that holds the mapping of identifiers (variable names) to values.

        // Scope Chain: The mechanism that allows functions to access variables and functions from their containing (enclosing) scopes.

        // Event Loop: In a browser environment, the event loop continuously checks the message queue for pending tasks. When the call stack is empty, the event loop dequeues tasks and pushes them onto the call stack for execution.

        // Microtasks and Macrotasks: JavaScript engines distinguish between microtasks (higher-priority tasks like Promises and MutationObserver) and macrotasks (lower-priority tasks like setTimeout and DOM events). Microtasks are processed before the next rendering, providing smoother user interactions.

        // Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: Many modern JavaScript engines use JIT compilation, which converts JavaScript code into machine code just before execution. This can significantly improve performance.
