// An anonymous function in JavaScript is a function that is defined without a name. Instead of providing a name for the function, you define it inline at the point where it's needed. Anonymous functions are often used as callback functions, in higher-order functions, and in situations where a function is used temporarily and doesn't need a distinct name.

        document.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
            console.log("hii whats app");
        });

        let sum = function(a,b){
            let add = a+b;
            console.log(add);
        }

        sum(1,2);
        sum(3,4);

    </script>
