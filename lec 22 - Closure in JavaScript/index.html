// A closure is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that occurs when a nested function "remembers" its lexical scope even after the outer function has finished executing. In simpler terms, a closure allows a function to access variables from its containing (enclosing) function, even after that function has completed execution. Closures play a crucial role in many aspects of JavaScript programming, including encapsulation, data privacy, and creating higher-order functions.

        const outerFun = (a) => {
            let b = 20;
            const innerFun = () => {
                let sum = a+b;
                console.log(`${a} + ${b} = ${sum}`);
            }
            // innerFun();
            return innerFun;
        }

        // outerFun(67);

        let inner = outerFun(123);
        console.dir(inner);
        inner();
